## LTT, Birth–Death, and Diversification Analyses (R)

This folder contains R scripts for analyzing lineage-through-time (LTT) patterns,
birth–death models, and diversification rates from phylogenetic trees.

The analyses focus on exploratory visualization and summary statistics commonly
used in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies.

### Features
- Lineage-through-time (LTT) plots
- Birth–death model–based summaries
- Diversification rate analysis

### Main R Packages Used
- `ape`
- `ggplot2`
- `ggtree`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`

### Notes
- Scripts assume phylogenetic trees in Newick format
- Code is modular and intended for experimentation and learning

### Disclaimer
Exploratory analysis code; methods and parameters may require adaptation
for specific datasets.
